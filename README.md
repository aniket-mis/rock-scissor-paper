# rock-scissor-paper

Version 1.00

This is simple game I have built using pythin v.3X.

The user have to input the options in interger 1,2 & 3.

1 stand for ROCK
2 stand for SCISSOR
3 stand for PAPER

Now this game is only run once.

In the last the game will show the score.

<THIS IS UNSTABLE VERSION>
